        <h2>What is C Programming ?</h2>
        <p>C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a
            structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various
            applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git,
            Python interpreter, and more.It is said that ‘C’ is a god’s programming language. One can say, C is a base
            for the programming. If you know ‘C,’ you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages
            that uses the concept of ‘C’.It is essential to have a background in computer memory mechanisms because it
            is an important aspect when dealing with the C programming language.

        <h2>History of C language</h2>
        <p>The base or father of programming languages is ‘ALGOL.’
            It was first introduced in 1960. ‘ALGOL’ was used on a large basis in European countries.
            ‘ALGOL’ introduced the concept of structured programming to the developer community.
            In 1967, a new computer programming language was announced called as ‘BCPL’ which stands for Basic Combined
            Programming Language.
            BCPL was designed and developed by Martin Richards, especially for writing system software.
            This was the era of programming languages.
            Just after three years, in 1970 a new programming language called ‘B’ was introduced by Ken Thompson that
            contained multiple features of ‘BCPL.’
            This programming language was created using UNIX operating system at AT&T and Bell Laboratories.
            Both the ‘BCPL’ and ‘B’ were system programming languages
        </p>
        <img src="./images/dennis Ritchie.jpg" alt="" height="20%" width="20%">
        <p>In 1972, a great computer scientist Dennis Ritchie created a new programming language called ‘C’ at the Bell
            Laboratories.
            It was created from ‘ALGOL’, ‘BCPL’ and ‘B’ programming languages.
            ‘C’ programming language contains all the features of these languages and many more additional concepts that
            make it unique from other languages.
        </p>
        <p>‘C’ is a powerful programming language which is strongly associated with the UNIX operating system.
            Even most of the UNIX operating system is coded in ‘C’.
            Initially ‘C’ programming was limited to the UNIX operating system, but as it started spreading around the
            world, it became commercial, and many compilers were released for cross-platform systems.
            Today ‘C’ runs under a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms.
            As it started evolving many different versions of the language were released.
            At times it became difficult for the developers to keep up with the latest version as the systems were
            running under the older versions.
            To assure that ‘C’ language will remain standard, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) defined a
            commercial standard for ‘C’ language in 1989.
            Later, it was approved by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in 1990.
            ‘C’ programming language is also called as ‘ANSI C’.

        <h2>How C Programming Language works?</h2>

        <p>C is a compiled language. A compiler is a special tool that compiles the program and converts it into the
            object file which is machine readable. After the compilation process, the linker will combine different
            object files and creates a single executable file to run the program. The following diagram shows the
            execution of a ‘C’ program</p>
        <center><img src="./images/working.jpg" alt=""> </center>
        <p>Nowadays, various compilers are available online, and you can use any of those compilers. The
            functionality will never differ and most of the compilers will provide the features required to execute
            both ‘C’ and ‘C++’ programs.</p>
        <p>Following is the list of popular compilers available online:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Clang compiler</li>
            <li> MinGW compiler (Minimalist GNU for Windows)</li>
            <li> Portable ‘C’ compiler</li>
            <li> Turbo C</li>
