# Assignment 9.2 - Hangman problem

#        Write a txt file which has a word in each line like:
#        Hands
#        Legs
#        India
#        Crow
#        Rain
#        ...

#        Write a python code to read the file and store the words in the list

#        Write a function to guess a word randomly from the list.

#        Now, write a function which asks user to guess the chosen word letter by letter.
#        Show "incorrect" message to the wrong guessed letter. 
#        Display  letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly. 

#        Let say word is EVAPORATE

#        >>> Welcome to Hangman!
#        _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
#        >>> Guess your letter: S
#        Incorrect!
#        You left with 5 chances to guess.

#        >>> Guess your letter: E
#        E _ _ _ _ _ _ _ E
#        ...
#        And so on.


#        1)Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
#        Keep track of the letters the user guessed.
#        2) If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, don’t penalize them - let them guess again.
#        3)When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
